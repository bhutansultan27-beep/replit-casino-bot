To implement Blackjack rules in a Telegram game, you need a precise and comprehensive set of rules that an AI can interpret and apply programmatically. Below is a detailed breakdown of standard Blackjack rules, written clearly for implementation purposes, covering all essential aspects including gameplay, payouts, and edge cases. These rules assume a standard 52-card deck and typical casino-style Blackjack (also known as "21").Blackjack Rules for Implementation1. ObjectiveThe goal is for players to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it ("busting").
Players compete against the dealer, not each other.

2. Deck and CardsDeck: Use one or more standard 52-card decks (no jokers). Common configurations are 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 decks. For Telegram, 1 or 2 decks is simpler for performance.
Card Values:Number cards (2-10): Worth their face value (e.g., 2 = 2 points, 10 = 10 points).
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Worth 10 points each.
Ace: Worth either 1 or 11 points, chosen to maximize the hand value without busting (e.g., Ace + 6 = 17, but Ace + 10 = 21, not 31).
Suits: Irrelevant to gameplay (e.g., a 5 of Hearts = 5 of Spades).
Shuffling: Shuffle the deck(s) before each round or when the shoe (deck) is depleted (e.g., less than 20% of cards remain). For simplicity, shuffle after every round in a Telegram game.

3. Game SetupPlayers: One or more players plus a dealer (the AI acts as the dealer).
Betting: Each player places a bet before cards are dealt (e.g., using virtual currency or points in Telegram).
Minimum and maximum bet limits should be defined (e.g., 1-100 units).
Dealing:Each player receives two cards, face-up.
The dealer receives two cards: one face-up (the "upcard"), one face-down (the "hole card").
Cards are dealt one at a time in rotation (e.g., Player 1 card 1, Player 2 card 1, Dealer card 1, etc.).
4. Hand ValuesTotal Hand Value: Sum of all card values in a hand.If a hand includes an Ace, calculate the total with Ace = 11 ("soft" hand) unless it causes a bust, then use Ace = 1 ("hard" hand).
Example: Ace + 7 = Soft 18; Ace + 7 + 6 = Hard 14 (Ace counts as 1 to avoid busting).
Blackjack: A two-card hand totaling exactly 21 (Ace + 10-value card, e.g., Ace + King).
Bust: A hand value exceeding 21 (e.g., 10 + 7 + 5 = 22). A bust results in an automatic loss.

5. Player ActionsAfter receiving their initial two cards, players take turns choosing actions. The AI must process these choices:Hit: Take one additional card. Players can hit multiple times until they stand or bust.
Stand: End their turn, keeping their current hand value.
Double Down:Double the initial bet and receive exactly one more card, then stand.
Allowed only on the first action after receiving two cards.
Restriction: Often limited to hands with a total of 9, 10, or 11 (configurable).
Split:If the two cards are of the same rank (e.g., two 8s or two Kings), split them into two separate hands.
Player places an additional bet equal to the original for the second hand.
Each hand receives a new second card.
Play each hand separately with normal actions (hit, stand, etc.).
Special cases:Aces Split: Typically, each split Ace receives only one additional card, and no further hits are allowed. A two-card 21 after splitting Aces is not a Blackjack (pays 1:1, not 3:2).
10-value cards: Some implementations allow splitting different 10-value cards (e.g., King + Queen). For simplicity, restrict to identical ranks (e.g., two Kings).
Surrender (optional, less common in casual games):Forfeit the hand and lose half the bet after seeing the dealer’s upcard.
Allowed only as the first action.
Not recommended for a Telegram game due to complexity.
6. Dealer’s TurnAfter all players complete their actions, the dealer reveals their hole card and plays according to fixed rules:Hit: If the dealer’s hand value is 16 or less, they must hit.
Stand: If the dealer’s hand value is 17 or more, they must stand.
Soft 17 Rule: Decide whether the dealer hits on a soft 17 (e.g., Ace + 6). Standard rule: Dealer hits on soft 17 (configurable for Telegram).
If the dealer busts, all non-busted players win.

7. Winning and PayoutsCompare Hands:If the player busts, they lose their bet, regardless of the dealer’s outcome.
If the dealer busts, non-busted players win.
If neither busts, compare hand values:Higher hand value wins.
Equal hand values result in a push (tie; bet is returned).
Blackjack:A player’s Blackjack (two-card 21) beats a dealer’s non-Blackjack 21 (e.g., 10 + 6 + 5).
If both player and dealer have Blackjack, it’s a push (unless specified otherwise).
Payouts:Standard Win: Pays 1:1 (e.g., bet 10 units, win 10 units + original bet returned).
Blackjack: Pays 3:2 (e.g., bet 10 units, win 15 units + original bet returned). Optionally, use 6:5 for simpler math in Telegram, but note this reduces player odds.
Push: Bet is returned, no win or loss.
Split Hands: Each hand is evaluated independently against the dealer.
Double Down: If the player wins after doubling, they receive 1:1 on the doubled bet (e.g., bet 10, double to 20, win 20 + 20 returned).
8. Insurance (Optional)If the dealer’s upcard is an Ace, offer players the option to place an insurance bet:Insurance bet is up to half the original bet (e.g., 5 units on a 10-unit bet).
If the dealer has Blackjack (checks hole card), insurance pays 2:1, and the player loses their original bet unless they also have Blackjack (push).
If the dealer does not have Blackjack, the insurance bet is lost, and play continues normally.
Recommendation: Skip insurance for a Telegram game to keep it simple, as it’s rarely advantageous for players.

9. Edge Cases and ClarificationsMultiple Splits: Allow splitting up to 3-4 hands total (e.g., if a player gets another pair after splitting). For simplicity, limit to one split in Telegram.
Dealer Blackjack:If the dealer’s upcard is an Ace or 10-value card, check for Blackjack before players act (to avoid unnecessary actions).
If the dealer has Blackjack, non-Blackjack player hands lose immediately (except for player Blackjacks, which push).
Five-Card Charlie (optional, non-standard):If a player has five cards without busting, they automatically win (pays 1:1). Rarely used; avoid for Telegram to reduce complexity.
Invalid Actions:If a player tries an invalid action (e.g., doubling on a soft 18), reject it and prompt for a valid choice.
Ensure the AI enforces rules (e.g., no hitting after doubling).
10. Game Flow for TelegramStart Round:Prompt players to place bets via Telegram buttons or commands (e.g., /bet 10).
Display the deal: player’s two cards and dealer’s upcard (e.g., “Your hand: 7, K (17). Dealer: A”).
Player Choices:Offer buttons or commands for actions: /hit, /stand, /double, /split (if applicable).
Update the hand display after each action (e.g., “Hit: 7, K, 4 (21)”).
Dealer’s Turn:Reveal dealer’s hole card and resolve their actions automatically.
Display final hands (e.g., “Dealer: A, 10 (Blackjack). You: 7, K (17)”).
Resolve Bets:Announce outcomes and update player balances (e.g., “You lose 10 units” or “Blackjack! You win 15 units”).
New Round:Prompt for new bets or end the game.
11. Implementation Notes for TelegramState Management: Track game state (bets, hands, dealer cards, balances) per user or chat session.
Randomization: Use a random number generator for shuffling and dealing cards (e.g., Python’s random.shuffle for a deck array).
User Interface:Use Telegram’s inline keyboards for actions (e.g., buttons for Hit, Stand, etc.).
Display cards with emojis (e.g., , , , ) for clarity.
Keep messages concise to avoid cluttering the chat.
Multiplayer (if applicable):Handle multiple players in a group chat by tracking each player’s hand and bet separately.
Process turns sequentially, showing each player’s actions to the group.
Error Handling:Validate bets (e.g., within balance and limits).
Prevent invalid actions (e.g., splitting non-pairs).
Persistence: Store player balances and game history (e.g., in a database or Telegram’s session storage) to maintain state across sessions.

12. Configurable OptionsTo simplify or customize for Telegram:Number of Decks: Use 1 deck for simplicity.
Blackjack Payout: Use 3:2 for authenticity or 1:1 for easier math.
Dealer Soft 17: Dealer hits on soft 17 (standard) or stands (simpler).
Double Down Restrictions: Allow on any two cards or limit to 9-11.
Split Limits: Allow one split or multiple.
Insurance/Surrender: Exclude to reduce complexity.
Betting Currency: Use virtual points or a Telegram-specific currency.

13. Example RoundPlayer bets 10 units.
Deal: Player gets 8, 9 (17); Dealer shows Q.
Player chooses /stand.
Dealer reveals hole card: 6 (total 16), hits, gets 7 (total 23, bust).
Player wins: “You win 10 units! New balance: 110 units.”
